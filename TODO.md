* Decoder devices
  * Decoder ring/wheel
  * Code Gears
  * Grid Lookup
    * Each column/row labeled with letter (or number)
    * A separate clue gives references to row/column letter/numbers
      * Can be a list of 2 word phrases to make it harder to identify
    * Works well when grid covers a map or image
      * Players find symbol in grid cell
    * Links: symbol substitution cipher, symbol algebra
  * Ribbon and Rod
  * Pendants reach to numbers
    * One or more images with peg in middle.
    * Different pendents hang on pegs
    * Pendant can be rotated around to find number at correct distance from peg.
    * Probably good to have first number to be straight down to lead players on how to solve
* Coded pictures
  * Run length encoding
  * Color by coordinates
  * Pegs and string
* Coded objects
  * Box of mystery
    * Players reach in to read code with hand
    * Links: Braille

* Mirrors
  * Reflected numbers
  * Half digits. Print half of symmetric digits that become whole when
      put against a mirror.
