summary: "Players must \"sketch\" a pattern on a directional lock."
---

In this puzzle, players are given a simple object to sketch. A drawing is
given with a particular direction to draw each line or curve of the sketch.
For example, you could provide the following figure to demonstrate how to
write out the word "HELLO" (perhaps for children just learning how to
write).

{{< example-image src="sketch-hello.png" >}}

To solve this puzzle, players must mimic the drawing directions in a
[directional lock]. For example, to "draw" the H, the players enter
down-down-right into the directional lock. Two "write" the entirety of this
word, players enter
down-down-right-down-right-right-right-down-right-down-right-left.

Another way to set up this puzzle is to have a template showing the
directions for all letters, and then instruct players to "write" out a
word. This level of indirection will make the puzzle harder.

The previous example used letters, but this puzzle could work with any
symbol. For example, here is a symbol with directions associated with it.

{{< example-image src="sketch-symbol.png" >}}

This example would require the directions right-down-left-right. To make
the puzzle a little more challenging, you can provide multiple symbols and
provide hints on which one to use.

When creating these diagrams, make sure that directions are given for each
curve. Also make sure that the directions are clearly left, right, up, or
down. Do not use diagonal if that is not supported by the physical lock.
You will see in these examples that diagonal lines still have an arrow in a
horizontal or vertical direction.
