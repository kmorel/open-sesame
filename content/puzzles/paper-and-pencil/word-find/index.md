A word find is a simple puzzle with a grid of letters and a list of words
hidden in the grid. Players need to find the sequence of letters in the
grid matching each word and encircle them.

The trick it to recognize that the bands around the words themselves form
a pattern to reveal a code.

Here is an example of a word find.

As with any word find, the target words are difficult to spot. With some
searching, the words can be found as follows.

Looking carefully, we can see the marks are arranged in the pattern of a
4-digit code: 4710.
