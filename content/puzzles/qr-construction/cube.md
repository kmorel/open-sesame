Turn a 3D rotating cube puzzle, like a [Rubik's Cube], into a key for your
escape room by gluing a QR code to one of its faces. Mix up the puzzle, and
then have the players unscramble the QR code to proceed.

To be clear, solving Rubik's Cube puzzles is tricky, and it is unreasonable
to expect players to solve the entire puzzle. But solving one face of the
cube is much easier, and someone not familiar with the puzzle should be
able to put together a QR code on one side.

This puzzle is easy to make, but there are a few things to keep in mind.

First, although the most common form of puzzle is made of 3x3x3 bricks,
consider getting a 2x2x2 puzzle like the one pictured above. This will be a
bit less time consuming for players, particularly those not experienced
with Rubik's Cube. More importantly, the 3x3x3 puzzle has a square in the
middle of each space that can be arbitrarily rotated in the solved face.
Rotating the middle section might break the QR code, and it is hard to
understand the correct orientation in a QR code.

Second, speaking of the orientation, it is possible to get all the correct
colors on the same face but in the wrong position. If this happens with the
QR code, the orientation will be wrong and it will not scan. Although not
pictured here, consider superimposing a second, more recognizable image on
the QR code, like demonstrated below, to help players orient the squares
correctly.

Third, remember that the alignment of the QR code pieces have to be fairly
precise to scan correctly. To help this, print the QR code to a heavy
weight paper to help it hold its shape as the puzzle is spun. Also, to make
sure the orientation is correct, glue the code on first and then cut it in
place. Put a dab of rubber cement on each square of the face and press the
QR code to the cube. Then take a sharp knife and cut the paper along the
seams of the cube.
