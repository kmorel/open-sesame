summary: "Make a jigsaw puzzle by cutting a QR code that players must reassemble."

Print a QR code, and then cut the code into pieces.

To solve the puzzle, the players have to place the pieces to form a square
and the correct QR code to scan and get the next clue.

The shape of the pieces does not matter a lot. However, it is better if
they are constructed such that there is only one way to form them back into
a square. They should also each contain a critical part of the QR code so
that the code cannot be scanned without all of the pieces. Lots of shapes
can satisfy these conditions, but here is a pattern that works
well.[^interlocking]

The players will have to place the pieces precisely to read the code
properly. To facilitate this, print a reasonably large code (about
4in/10cm). It also helps to print on a heavy weight paper.


[^interlocking]: Most people think of jigsaws as having interlocking
    pieces, which these suggested pieces clearly are not. So, perhaps this
    is technically more of a [tiling puzzle], but making the pieces
    interlocking is probably overkill.
