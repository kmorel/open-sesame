[Red herring] is an English idiom that refers to a clue that is misleading
or distracting. The phrase is often used within the context of a mystery
story where the detective collects many clues, some of which turn out to be
irrelevant. Red herrings help prevent the solution of a mystery from being
obvious before the reveal.

Red herrings are much less important in an escape room than in a mystery
story. Most escape rooms do not have red herrings, and you should not feel
obligated to add them. However, I enjoy throwing in a red herring or two to
throw players off guard.

I typically make the red herrings simple clues and puzzles. As an example,
a clue might be a typed letter with the following return address at top.

CCD Laboratories \

Atlanta, GA 30329

My family has done enough escape rooms to pay attention to numbers placed
within written material. So, I expect them to try these numbers in locks
around the room. But they won't work (snicker).

All that said, you don't want players to get too wrapped around trying to
make red herrings work. To this end, it is best to provide a cue that
something is a red herring. I've established with my family that when I use
the phrase "red herring," it signals that it will not help investigating
further. In the previous example, note that the street name is "Red
Herring." In another example, in one room I had a decoy QR code
(distracting from the real QR code players needed to construct).

The page has a hidden message text at the bottom:

{{% example font="normal" %}}
spi**R**its might d**E**ceive and play har**D** tricks to entertain
t**H**ems**E**lves, but for th**R**eats, you**R** best fr**I**e**N**d is a
**G**host.
{{% /example %}}

The message uses both [capital letters] and [highlight letters], making it
easy to see and decode. The message is "red herring," which is a signal for
players to stop looking.

Of course, you could use a different signal for a red herring. You could
instead say "just kidding," place a ðŸ˜œ, or [Rickroll] the players. Whatever
you choose, place it on red herring but never on legitimate clues.
