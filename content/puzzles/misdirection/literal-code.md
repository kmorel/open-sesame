summary: "The message literally gives a code, but the context implies a different meaning."

One of the most fun ways to hide a secret message is to literally write out
the message, but place it in a context that suggests a different meaning to
the word. Take, for example, this note that players might find.

{{% example %}}
Brett, the access code to engineering is wrong. You need to change it.
{{% /example %}}

At first glance, this appears to be a useless piece of information. It just
says that an access code is wrong, but it doesn't say what the wrong or
right code is.

On second glance, well, it still doesn't help.

The trick to this puzzle is to realize that the words can be interpreted in
another way. The message literally tells you that the access code is wrong.
The word "wrong" is used to open a combination lock or some other access
code. This leap in interpretation is difficult to make but seems so obvious
in retrospect.

This hidden in plain sight code can be formulated in many ways. The main
point is that the code word serves another function in the sentence it is
in. There should also be at least one other distracting sentence. Here is
another example.

{{% example %}}
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. To pick the password remove
the P's from that.
{{% /example %}}

Watch the players flail as they try to make sense of the first sentence
without the letter P. Then hear them groan when they figure out the
password is simply "that". ("that" with all P's removed is "that".)
