Place a clue on the bottom side of an object. This puzzle works similarly
to placing a clue [underneath] an object except that the clue is stuck to
the underside.

Picture of plate on table (and maybe also silverware) and then the bottom

The fun part about this puzzle is that sometimes players will pick up an
object to look underneath it, but miss the note that is stuck to the
underside.
