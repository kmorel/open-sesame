[Morse code] is the famous encoding of letters using a sequence of "dots"
and "dashes." This code is useful to send a message using a mode of
communication that can only transmit on and off. The signal is turned on
momentarily for a dot and a little longer for a dash.

Morse code was originally used to transmit messages over an electric
telegraph in which a sender closed a circuit on one end to activate a
clicker on the other end. But Morse code can also be communicated with
beeps of sound or flashes of light.

Here is a table for the international Morse code.

Although some people have memorized Morse code, most have not. So, you
should always provide the Morse code table unless you are very sure that the
players have memorized it.

Although you could provide a Morse code message on a piece of paper drawn
in circles and lines, the fun part of Morse code is to hide it in a beeping
or flashing item. This can be trickier to create than a simple printed
message or image. A straightforward way to provide a Morse code message is
to create an audio or video file that can be played on any number of
devices.

A fun thing to do with a Morse code message is to hide it in some unrelated
sight our sound. Spell the Morse code message in car horn honking, a dog
barking, or any other theme-appropriate repetitive sound. Or maybe that
flashing light on a buoy or satellite has a flashing pattern.

Players inexperienced with interpreting Morse code are likely to find the
task difficult. Therefore, it is best to keep the message short (one or two
words at most) and to give the code out slowly.
