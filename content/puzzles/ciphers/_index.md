A simple way to hide a message is to use a cipher to turn text into
gibberish. A cipher is a way to turn plain text into something
unrecognizable. When used as an escape room puzzle, the players get the
unrecognizable encrypted text and need to find and apply the appropriate
cipher to restore the plain text. Here are some ciphers appropriate for
escape room puzzles.

**TODO:**
  * Pigpen Cipher
  * Morse Code
  * Run length encoding
