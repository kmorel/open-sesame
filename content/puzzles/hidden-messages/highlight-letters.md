Hide a message in a note by highlighting letters that spell out a secret
code. The basic contents of the note itself just give some information
about the [plot]. But some of the letters in the note are clearly
highlighted and spell out a secret message or code.

Consider the following ominous note that players find.

{{% example style="color:#AAA;" %}}
Gree**t**ings adv**en**turers!

Welcome to **f**antasy at**o**ll. Make yo**ur**selves at home.

Do**n**'t pan**i**c. Percha**n**ce some of you will surviv**e**.
{{% /example %}}

Note the bold highlighting of some of the letters. If we write these out, we
get "ten four nine". This could be the combination for one of the locks in
the room: 1049.

The highlighting can be anything that distinguishes letters from others. In
this example the letters for the code are darker than those around them.
Other cues, such as color or background could be used. What is important is
that the highlighted letters are easily distinguished from the other
letters.

Because the highlighting is meant to be clear, this type of puzzle is
usually easy to solve. This is a good introductory puzzle for novice
players. See the other forms of [hidden messages] for more subtle ways of
hiding codes.
