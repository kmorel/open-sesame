A numeric code can be hidden in a message by writing a message that has
numbers as part of it. Here is an example.

Good job! You have reestablished my connection to our communication and
research notes. Since General Halftrack isolated me 3 days ago, I have
been desperate for help.

I need you to find the formula to the virus treatment that I developed
merely 2 days before I left for this emergency trip.

These 16 weeks on the road have been exhausting, and I'm so glad to be
able to talk to you again.

On reading this note carefully, you will notice that there are three
numbers that are part of it, taking the place of words: 3, 2, and 16.
Concatenating these numbers together we get the code 3216.

In the previous message, the numbers are highlighted by representing them
numerically. For an extra challenge, write out the numbers as words.
