For the code-word lookup puzzle, players need to put together two clues.
The first clue is the message itself. But the message alone does not have
any real meaning. To get the meaning, the players need to put the message
together with a second clue containing a list of code words and their
meaning (which may just be a digit for a numeric password).

Here is an example I have used. The players find an old diary with the
following entry.

Dear Diary,

Today was the best Day of my life. I met the man of my dreams: Todd. We met
at the park. He was walking his ferret. I was hiding in the bushes. He is
sooooo cute with his pouting Lips and big brown Eyebrows. I didn't have the
courage to talk, but I did find out where he lives. Tomorrow, we'll "meet"
again. I'll bring Mr. Knife for luck.

This message alone does not provide anything of value. However, in another
box the players find this page from a scientific psychology paper.

Most of the text of this "paper" is nonsense. The important part is the
enumerated lists provided. To solve the puzzle, the players have to match
words in the diary message to the listed words in the paper and use the
associated numbers to build the passcode. (The message inappropriately
capitalizes these words to help players make this connection and pick out
the appropriate words.) The words to pick out are "Day", "Lips",
"Eyebrows", and "Knife", which correspond to the digits 4, 4, 8, and 2,
respectively. Thus, the passcode is 4482.

A variant of this method is the [crossword lookup] where instead of
providing the code-word lookup in a list, it is hidden in a crossword
puzzle.
