Spell out a secret word by rotating or flipping letters. Most of the
letters will be normal, but some will be placed in a weird orientation.

In the message above, an observant reader needs to see that there are 5
letters upside down. They spell out "cream", which could be a secret
password.

Using rotated or mirrored letters can be tricky. You need to make sure to
use letters with enough asymmetry to be able to tell the transformed
letters from normal ones. Letters like "o", "x", and "l" will be difficult
to see.

Because letter options are often limited, another way to use
rotated/flipped letters is simply change one letter of words to include in
the secret.

I used to tend bar at the Lucky Thirtəen club. Onə day a beautiful woman
ran in. She was beautiful even with her disheveled dress and chipped polish
on tʍo nails. She needed help.

In this message, there are upside-down letters in the words thirteen, one,
and two, revealing the code 1312.

One way to create rotated letters is to use special characters of flipped
letters, which can be copied from [special Unicode characters]. But a more
versatile way to do it is to rotate or flip images of characters in an
image editor.
