summary: "A group of sticks with letters form a message when arranged correctly."
---

This puzzle arranges the letters of a message in a grid. The words read,
naturally enough,[^direction] from left to right. However, the grid is
written on sticks or other skinny objects oriented vertically so the
message can only be read when the items reform the grid.

The puzzle starts with the players finding a collection of sticks with
letters on them. They may all be provided together or, for an added
challenge, distributed among multiple boxes to keep the players guessing
when they have them all. Unarranged, the sticks look like a hodgepodge of
letters.

In the easiest form of this puzzle, at the top of each stick is a
highlighted letter that is used as a key to arrange the sticks in the
appropriate order. The word can be anything recognizable, but it is helpful
to have it related to the objects being used or the location they are
found.

With the sticks in the correct order, the letters can be read tor form
words: LOOK UNDER CHAIRS.

For a bit of an extra challenge, you can leave out the key word at the top.
Players should still be able to arrange the sticks to form the actual
words.

To make this puzzle _really_ challenging, have the sticks arranged
unevenly. Provide a clue that suggests a sequence of letters (each uniquely
listed). The players have to find not only the order but also the vertical
positions. In this example, a separate clue gives a sequence of elements
(Vanadium, Indium, Carbon, Iodine, and Cobalt). With the help of a periodic
table, these element symbols (V, In, C, I, Co) are found on these sticks
and lined.

Now in the proper orientation, the letters of these elemental symbols form
a message.


[^direction]: This is of course assuming you are writting the message in
    English or another language that reads from left to right. If writing
    in a language that goes right to left or top to bottom, adjust
    accordingly.
