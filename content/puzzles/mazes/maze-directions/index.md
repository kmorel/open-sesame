summary: "Follow the path of a maze with a directional lock."

This puzzle involves a simple maze. The maze should be relatively small and
only have right-angled turns. Here is an example.

The path from start to finish involves moving in straight lines to the
left, right, up, or down directions.

The directions used to solve this maze are used in combination with a
[directional lock]. The lock is moved in the same directions as the path
used to solve the maze.

So, in this example, the correct path goes right, up, left, up, left, down,
right. The directional lock is moved in these directions to open it.

Although the maze could specify the start and finish directly as in the
example above, the puzzle can be worked into a room by adding multiple
labels of different locations. Here is an example of using the previous
maze as an interconnection of rooms.

In this case, there needs to be a hint to direct players from the "office
space" to "manufacturing." The directions they take for that are entered
into the directional lock.
