This puzzle first involves a map. The map can be mounted on the wall or
made available in a box. The map can be of real or imaginary places. It can
be global or for a local area. It does not matter but the location and
scale should match the theme of the escape room.

For the example below, I am using a [digital world map provided by the UN].
This map likely has more detail than is easily printed for use by players.
For a world map, consider using a commercially printed map. You might
already have a large-format world map in your house. Or perhaps you have a
globe. Or you might even have a board game with a convenient map printed on
its board such as Risk or Pandemic.

The second clue of this puzzle involves a collection of locations on this
map. The players might find multiple airline tickets with the following
departures and destinations. (They are shown in a table here for brevity,
but it will be more interesting to provide each of these transfers on their
own card.)

{{% example %}}

| Depart          | Arrive          |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| DR of the Congo | Egypt           |
| Egypt           | India           |
| India           | Mongolia        |
| Mongolia        | Ukraine         |
| Peru            | DR of the Congo |
| United States   | Peru            |

An optional third component of this puzzle is a hint for the proper order
of the locations. In this example, the connections of the departures to
arrivals trace out a path. Another clue could be to assign a date to each
location or order by some property of the locations (such as population).
If players are expected to reorder them, it is best to provide each
location on a separate card to make sorting easier. For a simpler puzzle,
simply provide the list of locations in the proper order.

Given the clue above, the order in which the locations were visited are as
follows.

{{% example %}}

| Location        |
| --------------- |
| United States   |
| Peru            |
| DR of the Congo |
| Egypt           |
| India           |
| Mongolia        |
| Ukraine         |

Once the players have determined the proper order of locations, they have
to trace out the path on the provided map.

{{< example-image src="world-map-path.jpg" link="world-map-path.pdf" >}}

A key feature of this path is that each segment goes primarily in a
cardinal direction: north, south, east, or west. In this example, the path
goes south, east, north, east, north, west.

This sequence of directions is finally used to open a [directional lock]
with the directions corresponding to the directions on the map. In this
case, the lock opens up with the code down, right, up, right, up, left.
