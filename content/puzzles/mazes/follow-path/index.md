In this simple puzzle, players are given a drawn maze with a clear start
and finish. Embedded within the maze are numbers or letters.

To solve this puzzle, players must follow the path from start to finish.
Standard maze rules apply: no crossing lines, no back tracking. The maze
should have a single, well defined path. One path leads from start to
finish with all other turns leading to dead ends. This path from start to
finish will pass through a sequence of numbers/letters.

The sequence of numbers/letters forms the code. In this example, the code
is ENTER.

You can construct the maze yourself, but there exist many free maze
generators online that will easily construct one for you.
