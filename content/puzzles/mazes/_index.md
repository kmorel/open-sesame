summary: "The players must find and navigate a maze."

It is probably impractical to construct a maze that players can physically
enter. Instead, players are provided a printed maze that must be navigated
to find a code to progress. Some mazes are more subtle than others.

Maze puzzles can be used to simulate the traveling. This might mean
navigating a complex space (such as a series of air vents) or traveling
long distances (such as flying across the globe).
