summary: "The missing pieces in a jigsaw puzzle reveal a code."
---

In this puzzle, players are given pieces of a jigsaw puzzle to complete.
The jigsaw is missing pieces, and the holes of the missing pieces form
numbers.

This puzzle uses a standard jigsaw puzzle set. A 300-piece puzzle is a good
size to make it work. Constructing a jigsaw puzzle this size takes too long
for the pace of an escape room, so a mostly completed puzzle should be
provided.

Throughout the game, players are given puzzle pieces that can be assembled
in the jigsaw. When all the pieces are correctly placed, a code is
revealed.

For a fun addition to the puzzle, split the pieces into two sets. The first
set reveals one set of numbers, which are a red herring. The second set of
pieces fills more of the holes to reveal different numbers. For example,
the numbers above could be further filled in with a different set of
numbers.

This puzzle is more time consuming than difficult. It is a good puzzle to
have to occupy players that may be uncomfortable with solving more unique
puzzles. It is also a puzzle that all players can work together on.

That said, it will take time for players to find the placement for the
jigsaw puzzle pieces they are given. As such, I recommend providing the
initial partially assembled in the first room and provide at least the
first set of pieces well before the code is needed.

Most assembled jigsaw puzzles arrange the pieces roughly in a grid. This
will make it straightforward to construct digits as holes in the jigsaw.
Any digit can be constructed in a 3x5 area of puzzle.

If possible, pick a distinct color for each region of each digit (something
that is not done well in the example above). This will help players
construct the jigsaw faster, which is good as construction of the jigsaw
puzzle takes much longer than a typical escape room puzzle.
