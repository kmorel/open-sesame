With some pulleys, levers, or other simple machines, you can make your
escape a live space that responds to the players actions.

Commercial escape rooms often have moving parts to respond to the players'
puzzle solving and progression in the game. These are often driven by
electronics and motors. Such machines are likely beyond the cost and time
for a one-time escape game in your house.

Our goal with these "puzzles" is to replicate the experience of actions
happening in response to actions using cheap and simple means. Some of
these machines are in response to solving a puzzle. Others can form part of
a puzzle.
