The puzzles are the best part of any escape room. The puzzles used for an
escape room tend to differ from those you might find in, say, a book of
crossword or Sudoku puzzles. Where the mechanisms to solve a crossword
puzzle are roughly the same from one to the next, each escape room puzzle
is different. You won't know how to solve an escape room puzzle at first;
you might not even recognize it as a puzzle right away. The trick to the
best puzzles requires lateral thinking to use objects and information in
abnormal ways.

These pages provide suggestions on puzzles you might use for your own
escape rooms.
