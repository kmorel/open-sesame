This puzzle starts with an image that has a grid on it. The image is often
a map or floor plan, but could really be anything. The important part is
that a letter (or number) is assigned to each horizontal and vertical
location of the grid.

The second part of this puzzle is a clue that suggests pairs of letters (or
numbers).

B-L

F-N

C-M

D-I
{{% /example %}}

The puzzle is solved by recognizing that the pairs can be used in reference
to the rows and columns of the grid. In this example, the pair B-L
references the map row labeled B and the map column labeled L. The grid
block corresponding to this row and column has a 5 in it. Repeating with
the remaining pairs, we get grid cells with the numbers 4, 6, and 5,
respectively. This gives us an overall code of 5464.

The puzzle formed in this way is fairly straightforward. To make the puzzle
more challenging, make the pairs of letters less obvious. You can do this
by providing a list of two word phrases. The phrases alone do not make
sense. The trick is that the first letter of each word refers to a row or
location in the grid. For example, consider the list below.

### Spy Tools

Bugged Lapel

False Narrative

Coded Message

Disappearing Ink
{{% /example %}}

The first letters of each line are B-L, F-N, C-M, and D-I, which provide
the same lookup as before.
