summary: "A template of a seven-segment display reveals numbers in an odd pattern."
---

The decoder device in this puzzle is a piece of paper with holes cut into
it that form some or all of the bars in a [seven-segment display].

{{< example-image src="number-template.webp" width="300px" >}}

In my example here, I have cut only 6 of the 7 segments as the none of the
numbers in the code I am using need that segment.

The other part of this puzzle is the coded pattern.

Neither piece of the puzzle makes sense on its own. But when the template
is placed on top of the coded pattern in the correct positions, numbers are
revealed.

As can be seen in this example, the correct code is 3594.

When creating the coded pattern make sure there are enough cues for players
to know how to align the decoder template on the pattern. The decoder must
be placed precisely to reveal the correct number. In the example here, you
will see that there are boxes to show where to place the decoder and an
arrow to define which way is up on the paper.

The patterns for this example are [posted
here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Zic5HYOMT3433VBN_uZrN9TnVB0F5FhPq9Wf7F8WxZY/).

The example here has one decoder number that has to be moved to multiple
locations to reveal all the numbers. An alternate approach could be to
create a template decoder that has holes for all the numbers together. This
would mean that placing the decoder in one spot reveals all numbers. A fun
change to this puzzle would be to have the holes in the decoder form one
set of numbers, but when applied to the code pattern, a different number is
revealed.
