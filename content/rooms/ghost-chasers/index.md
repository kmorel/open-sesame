## Synopsis

_Ghost Chasers_ is an escape room that puts players in the role of
paranormal investigators. The room has plenty of puzzles, fun theming, and
multiple developments in the plot. When creating the puzzles for this room,
I incorporated ideas from actual tools used in paranormal investigations.
Whether you believe in them or not, it is fun to pretend.

The game is divided into two spaces. The first space features a dining
table with place setting. A dining area is perfect for this space. The
second space represents the spirt world. It should be a dark space with
spooky lighting and decorations. Black lights and Halloween decorations
work well here. The [flow diagram] is drawn at the end of this page.

## Scenario

You (the players) are paranormal investigators. Yesterday, a desparate
voice on the phone called you to a mansion on the outskirts of town. When
you arrive, the door pushes open when you knock, but your host is not there
to greet you. When you step inside, the door slams shut and latches behind
you. A moment later, candles flicker to life on their own. The room looks
normal, but the lack of living people is unnerving. You can feel that there
is something wrong.

It is time to get to work. Collect the tools of your trade and investigate
what spirits may be infesting this site.


## Living Space (Room 1)

The players start in the normal living area of a home. The space is
intended to be the area of a house where one might meet guests. A dining
room works well for this space.

The room should contain a table with several place settings of plates,
glasses, forks, knives, etc.
