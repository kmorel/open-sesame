## Synopsis

_Ghost Chasers_ is an escape room that puts players in the role of
paranormal investigators. The room has plenty of puzzles, fun theming, and
multiple developments in the plot. When creating the puzzles for this room,
I incorporated ideas from actual tools used in paranormal investigations.
Whether you believe in them or not, it is fun to pretend.

The game is divided into two spaces. The first space features a dining
table with place setting. A dining area is perfect for this space. The
second space represents the spirt world. It should be a dark space with
spooky lighting and decorations. Black lights and Halloween decorations
work well here. The [flow diagram] is drawn at the end of this page.

## Scenario

You (the players) are paranormal investigators. Yesterday, a desparate
voice on the phone called you to a mansion on the outskirts of town. When
you arrive, the door pushes open when you knock, but your host is not there
to greet you. When you step inside, the door slams shut and latches behind
you. A moment later, candles flicker to life on their own. The room looks
normal, but the lack of living people is unnerving. You can feel that there
is something wrong.

It is time to get to work. Collect the tools of your trade and investigate
what spirits may be infesting this site.


## Living Space (Room 1)

The players start in the normal living area of a home. The space is
intended to be the area of a house where one might meet guests. A dining
room works well for this space.

The room should contain a table with several place settings of plates,
glasses, forks, knives, etc.


## Start Tool Collection (Box 1)

The players get together their ghost hunting tools. This first box
collects items for opening up the tool boxes.

**Suggested Puzzle** Mountd on one wall is [a sequence of digits]. Mounted
on the opposite wall is a mirror. The players need to solve a [reflected
code] puzzle by positioning themselves to view the digits in the mirror.
The mirror reflection has the correct code to open the lock.

## Ectoplasm Reveal Tool (Box 2)

The players collect some tools they need for their task. The first tool on
the list is an "ectoplasm reveal tool."

**Suggested Puzzle** The cutlery in the place settings on the dining
table look normal. But on the [underside] of the knives are letters. The
letters will make little sense at first, but the knives can be put together
in a [stick word grid]. The words spell out a message that points to a
location for players to find a key where they [normally would not look]. I
made the message "look under chairs".

The key opens a box that contains, among other things, an "ectoplasm reveal
tool" (an ultraviolet light). It will be used later to [reveal secret
messages].

[reveal secret messages]: /puzzles/decoders/invisible-ink/


## EMF Tool (Box 3)

Another tool the players connect is an electromagnetic frequency (EMF)
detector. An EMF detector reads emissions that come from electric power
lines and electric devices. Some paranormal investigators believe that
ghosts can emit electromagnetic radiation and use EMF detectors to attempt
to find ghosts.

**Suggested Puzzle** Create an imitation EMF that contains a [map of the
room] that points to the location of a hidden object. The item might be a
key, which is easy to hide, that opens a larger box.

I created the map as a [simple web site] that imitated the EMF tool and
provided the map. There are straightforward tools for [publishing web
sites] even for users with no such experience. An even easier solution is
to drop a map image as an [online document].

A QR code is used to direct players to the online map. I used a [QR Cube],
but any [QR puzzle] would work.

## EVP Tool (Box 4)

The players search for an electronic voice phenomenon (EVP). EVP is a real
thing that paranormal investigators do. The idea is to do an audio
recording in a quiet room. Then you play back the recording and listen for
stuff in the background static. (Our pretend tool will work better than in
real life.)

**Suggested Puzzle** The first step is to have a [QR construction] puzzle
that will make a players phone EVP recorder. Here is a [fold back QR]
puzzle from [box 1] with a QR code that will take players to an [EVP
simulator].

{{< example-image src="fold-back-qr.png" link="fold-back-qr.pdf" >}}

In the [EVP simulator], players first have to hit the "Record" button and
then wait for the recording. Players will then be able to play back the
recording. They will first have to hit the "Vol Up" button until the volume
level is high. Once they do, they can play the following audio.

{{< example-audio src="evp-high.mp3" >}}

If the players listen carefully, in the static they can hear the numbers
six-six-four-three.

## Research (Box 5)

The players collect some research materials.

**Suggested Puzzle** Players have to find printed messages [underneath] or
[on the underside] of the plates in the place settings. The message
initially does not mean anything, but a further clue is revealed with the
UV flashlight ([ectoplasm tool]).

There are at least two ways to set up this puzzle. If you have a word lock,
print a single word under each plate to form a meaningless phrase, and then
circle one of the words with [an invisible ink pen]. The players must
reveal the word with the UV flashlight and use that word on a lock.

If you prefer to use a number lock, print a single digit under each plate
and place them in random order. In [invisible ink], write numbers to
indicate the order of the digits to form a code for a lock.

## Summon Lizzy (Box 6)

The players use the tools at hand to summon the spirit that is haunting
this house. The players are contacted by a spirit who identifies itself as
"Lizzy." In the box have a picture of Lizzy. (The picture can be of any
innocent looking girl. Find a random picture on the internet or that comes
with a photo frame.) The picture comes wtih the following message.

{{% example %}}
Help! I'm Lizzy and I think I may have been murdered. Now I'm stuck in this
limbo space: not alive, not dead. If I don't escape soon, the wraiths will
steal my soul forever. Open the portal to the spiritual world, release the
spirit, and save my soul!
{{% /example %}}

After the players open this box, you can play this audio file (for example,
from a smartphone) to reinforce the situation.

{{< example-audio src="lizzy-help.mp3" >}}

**Suggested Puzzle** The players summon Lizzy with a [Ouija board]. You can
simulate this by shining the UV flashlight ([ectoplasm tool]) on a provided
Ouija board. The revealed ink shows the path of the entrance code word.

{{% example %}}
TODO: Picture of Ouija board with invisible ink.
{{% /example %}}

You could probably construct this puzzle with a store-bought Ouija board.
But if you are cheap, like me, you can just [print] the pattern of a board
on a piece of paper. When I originally did this, I first attempted to print
an image of a board (like [this
one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouija#/media/File:Ouija_board_-_Kennard_Novelty_Company.png).
This, however, did not work because the invisible ink pen smeared the
printer ink just enough to make out the path of the ink. Instead, you can
use [this replica of a Ouija board with a blank background] so you can draw
in the blank space between letters.
