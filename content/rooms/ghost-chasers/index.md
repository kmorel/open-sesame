## Synopsis

_Ghost Chasers_ is an escape room that puts players in the role of
paranormal investigators. The room has plenty of puzzles, fun theming, and
multiple developments in the plot. When creating the puzzles for this room,
I incorporated ideas from actual tools used in paranormal investigations.
Whether you believe in them or not, it is fun to pretend.

The game is divided into two spaces. The first space features a dining
table with place setting. A dining area is perfect for this space. The
second space represents the spirt world. It should be a dark space with
spooky lighting and decorations. Black lights and Halloween decorations
work well here. The [flow diagram] is drawn at the end of this page.

## Scenario

You (the players) are paranormal investigators. Yesterday, a desparate
voice on the phone called you to a mansion on the outskirts of town. When
you arrive, the door pushes open when you knock, but your host is not there
to greet you. When you step inside, the door slams shut and latches behind
you. A moment later, candles flicker to life on their own. The room looks
normal, but the lack of living people is unnerving. You can feel that there
is something wrong.

It is time to get to work. Collect the tools of your trade and investigate
what spirits may be infesting this site.


## Living Space (Room 1)

The players start in the normal living area of a home. The space is
intended to be the area of a house where one might meet guests. A dining
room works well for this space.

The room should contain a table with several place settings of plates,
glasses, forks, knives, etc.


## Start Tool Collection (Box 1)

The players get together their ghost hunting tools. This first box
collects items for opening up the tool boxes.

**Suggested Puzzle** Mountd on one wall is [a sequence of digits]. Mounted
on the opposite wall is a mirror. The players need to solve a [reflected
code] puzzle by positioning themselves to view the digits in the mirror.
The mirror reflection has the correct code to open the lock.

## Ectoplasm Reveal Tool (Box 2)

The players collect some tools they need for their task. The first tool on
the list is an "ectoplasm reveal tool."

**Suggested Puzzle** The cutlery in the place settings on the dining
table look normal. But on the [underside] of the knives are letters. The
letters will make little sense at first, but the knives can be put together
in a [stick word grid]. The words spell out a message that points to a
location for players to find a key where they [normally would not look]. I
made the message "look under chairs".

The key opens a box that contains, among other things, an "ectoplasm reveal
tool" (an ultraviolet light). It will be used later to [reveal secret
messages].

## EMF Tool (Box 3)

Another tool the players connect is an electromagnetic frequency (EMF)
detector. An EMF detector reads emissions that come from electric power
lines and electric devices. Some paranormal investigators believe that
ghosts can emit electromagnetic radiation and use EMF detectors to attempt
to find ghosts.

**Suggested Puzzle** Create an imitation EMF that contains a [map of the
room] that points to the location of a hidden object. The item might be a
key, which is easy to hide, that opens a larger box.

I created the map as a [simple web site] that imitated the EMF tool and
provided the map. There are straightforward tools for [publishing web
sites] even for users with no such experience. An even easier solution is
to drop a map image as an [online document].

A QR code is used to direct players to the online map. I used a [QR Cube],
but any [QR puzzle] would work.

## Research (Box 4)

The players collect some research materials.

**Suggested puzzle** Players have to find printed messages [underneath] or
[on the underside] of the plates in the place settings. The message
initially does not mean anything, but a further clue is revealed with the
UV flashlight ([ectoplasm tool]).

There are at least two ways to set up this puzzle. If you have a word lock,
print a single word under each plate to form a meaningless phrase, and then
circle one of the words with [an invisible ink pen]. The players must
reveal the word with the UV flashlight and use that word on a lock.

If you prefer to use a number lock, print a single digit under each plate
and place them in random order. In [invisible ink], write numbers to
indicate the order of the digits to form a code for a lock.
