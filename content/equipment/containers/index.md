Once you have locks, the next thing you will need is stuff to lock up. Any
escape room is going to make use of several containers (i.e. "boxes") that
hold items providing clues to the next puzzle.

A commercial escape room builds most of these boxes into the room's set.
How elaborately you wish to match the boxes to your theme is up to you.
Most likely you already have many containers like luggage, backpacks,
cases, and storage cases. Even cardboard boxes can be leveraged.
