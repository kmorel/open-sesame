This page lists some of the basic equipment that you will need to construct
a basic at-hoe escape room. The first items are required, but cheap and can
be improvised, so you can probably build the escape room with items lying
around your home.

The later items are things that are helpful, but relatively expensive. If
you have them, great. If not, don't fret.

Note that although in some cases there are suggestions on equipment that
you can use, I have no affiliation with any of these items or their
manufacturers.
