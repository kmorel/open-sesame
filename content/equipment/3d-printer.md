To be clear, you do _not_ need a 3D printer to create an escape room.
Although there are many affordable options, 3D printing is a hobby onto
itself.

If you happen to have access to a 3D printer, it can be helpful to
fabricate items as you need them, which can make life easier. If you have
one, you will probably use it. But if you don't, it will still be possible
to find, buy, construct, or jury-rig everything you need for a great at
home escape room.
